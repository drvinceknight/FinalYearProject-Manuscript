\chapter{Results}\label{cha:results}

In this chapter, the implementation of a fingerprint function within the Axelrod-Python library will be examined.
This includes the addition of two strategy transformers, the Dual and JossAnn as defined in \ref{}. %TODO
Then several results will be presented where analytical fingerprints are compared with analytical ones.
A discussion that compares different fingerprints of strategies within Axelrod-Python will also be given.
