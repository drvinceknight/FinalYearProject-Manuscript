\chapter{Results}\label{cha:results}

In this chapter, the implementation of a fingerprint function within the Axelrod-Python library will be examined.
This includes the addition of two strategy transformers, the Dual and JossAnn as defined in \ref{}. %TODO
Then several results will be presented where analytical fingerprints are compared with analytical ones.
A discussion that compares different fingerprints of strategies within Axelrod-Python will also be given.

\section{The Dual}
The dual of a strategy is defined such that when when the original strategy and the dual are presented with identical histories they will return opposite actions.
This can be achieved by having the original strategy as an attribute of the dual.
Whenever the dual has to submit a move, it can first get the original strategy to suggest what move should be made, and then flip that action.
